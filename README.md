Smart Vision Technology for Quality Control

Overview

This project implements a Smart Vision Technology solution for automating quality control processes. It utilizes advanced imaging systems and algorithms to capture and analyze visual information, helping identify product defects, quantity, and quality attributes. With additional functionalities like 3D modeling, the system is a robust tool for quality assurance in manufacturing and other industries.

Key Features

Text Extraction: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from product images for efficient label recognition.

Image Capture: Captures high-definition product images via a camera for further analysis.

3D Modeling: Generates 3D models of products for enhanced inspection and defect detection.

MQTT Integration: Connects to a client using the MQTT protocol to transmit real-time data.
